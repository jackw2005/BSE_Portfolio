# Third Eye for the Blind
Hi, my name is Jack, and this project is a Third Eye for the Blind. This is an arduino based project that is intended to help visually-impaired people by giving them a wearable device tell them how close they are to an object. It uses a buzzer and vibrating motor to do so, and either can be turned off with the flip of a switch for the wearer's preference

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was getting all of the components into on compact module. I did this by using a perfboard, which I placed all of my

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was setting up all of the wiring and components through a breadboard and coding to make sure the components worked together. First I had to do a couple of tests to make sure all of the components worked before putting them all together. I ran the LED, vibrating motor, and buzzer through a circuit to make sure each of them worked. Then, I had to test the sensor. I researched a code from Arduino and uploaded it into my Arduino Micro, which is running this project, that told the sensor to print out the distance to an object in front of it, so I could make sure it was giving out accurate readings. After making sure all of the components worked, I wired them together and coded so that as the sensor got closer to something, the LED would blink faster, the vibrating motor would vibrate more often, and the buzzer buzzed more. I also implemented a switch system so that you could turn off the LED, buzzer, motor, or any combination of the three by breaking up that circuit, which makes it more customizable to the preference of the person wearing it.
